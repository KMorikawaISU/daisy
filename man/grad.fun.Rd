\title{Dual gradient factory for generalized EB}
\usage{
grad.fun(X, MU, divergence, r = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{numeric matrix n x p of balancing features (no intercept column).}

\item{MU}{numeric length-p vector of target feature means (no intercept component).}

\item{divergence}{character in {"KL","LW","QLS","TS"}.}

\item{r}{numeric tuning for LW/QLS/TS (ignored for KL).}
}
\value{
A function of \code{lambda} returning the gradient
\verb{E[rho(X lambda) X] - MU}, where rho depends on the divergence.
